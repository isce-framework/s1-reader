# s1-reader

A package to read Sentinel-1 data into the ISCE3-compatible burst class.

## Features

Create ISCE3-compatible Sentinel1 burst class given:

- S1 SAFE
- subswath index
- polarization
- path to orbit directory

Creates a Burst ID based on [ESA's published burst ID maps](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/-/publication-of-brust-id-maps-for-copernicus-sentinel-1/1.1).

üö® This toolbox is still in **pre-alpha** stage and undergoing **rapid development**. üö® 

## Install

`s1reader` is available to install via `conda-forge`:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge s1reader
```

### Installing for development

1. Download source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opera-adt/s1-reader.git
cd s1-reader
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yaml
```

3. Install `s1reader` via pip:

```bash
# run "pip install -e" to install in development mode
python -m pip install -e .
```

## Usage

The following sample code demonstrates how to process a single burst from a S1 SAFE zip:

```python
import s1reader

zip_path = "S1A_IW_SLC__1SDV_20190909T134419_20190909T134446_028945_03483B_B9E1.zip"
swath_num = 2
pol = "VV"

# read orbits
orbit_dir = '/home/user/data/sentinel1_orbits'
orbit_path = s1reader.get_orbit_file_from_dir(zip_path, orbit_dir, auto_download=True)

# returns the list of the bursts
bursts = s1reader.load_bursts(zip_path, orbit_path, swath_num, pol)
burst_ids = [x.burst_id for x in bursts]
```
